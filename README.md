# Project_Challenge_Day20

Email Classifier ðŸ“§ðŸ¤–

A Python project that classifies emails into categories like spam or important, helping organize and manage inboxes efficiently. Built as part of the 30-Day Coding Challenge with Swara Gharat.

Features

Classifies emails as Spam or Important

Analyzes patterns in email content for accurate predictions

Uses machine learning to automate email organization

Simple Python interface for testing and experimentation

Key Concepts Learned

Pandas for data preprocessing

Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling

TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis

Practical implementation of a text classification model

Dataset

The project uses a labeled email dataset with categories such as spam and important. The dataset is processed and vectorized for model training.

How It Works

Emails are preprocessed to clean and standardize text.

Features are extracted using TF-IDF vectorization.

A machine learning model is trained to classify emails.

The trained model can predict categories for new emails.

Project Outcome

This project demonstrates how Python and ML can automate everyday tasks, like managing emails, making digital life smarter and more productive.
